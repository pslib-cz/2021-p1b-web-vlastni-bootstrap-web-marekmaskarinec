Some stuff I work on. Some of it work.



<a href="https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/klak">klak</a>


Klak is a concatenative programming language. It is compiled to c, but I plan
on adding js support if I ever want to suffer. It is in working-ish state.

<a href="https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/libs">umka libs and utils</a>


I wanted to try doing something like cc's -MM, but for umka in umka.
Because I wanted to do it as fast as possible, I decided to use my favorite
strings.split parsing technique. There was one problem: there was no string
library for umka. So I wrote one. Then I wrote another and another and I
ended up with a good collection of not only libraries but utilities.

<a href="https://github.com/prokoprandacek/glowi">ctopus~lt~glowing octopus</a>


This is not my project, but I still think it is worth mentioning. She is an
automatic factorio player. Still work in progress as factorio isn't exactly
simple, but it can produce some interesting results.

<a href="https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/aup~">up</a>


Aup is an an umka packager. It can automatically create binaries
containing umka programs. Even with c dependencies!

<a href="https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/msea">lt~msearch</a>


Center centric pipable search menu for linux with vim shortcuts, because I had
nothing to do.

<a href="https://github.com/marekmaskarinec/jam-">issions~lt~jam submissions</a>


Both complete and incomplete jam games. Some of the might not work anymore.


There are tons of other projects but they are not worth enough to be here.
