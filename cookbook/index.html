Welcome to the tophat cookbook. You can find all sorts of recipes for doing
common stuff in tophat.

<h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom" id="concepts">1. basic tophat concepts</h2>

<p>
	To fully understand examples in the cookbook, it is important to know the basic
	concepts used in tophat.
	
	Tophat doesn't have any kind of scenes. Everything is structured and managed by
	the player. User has to explicitly call functions into tophat to get results or
	draw stuff. Tophat doesn't do nearly anything automatically - the user is in
	front of the steering wheel.
	
	In communication with tophat, there are some types used, which are good to know.
	They are defined in the <a href="//docs/th.html">th.um</a> module. First of them is th.Vf2. It is a 2d
	vector. It contains x and y - both of the type th.fu. th.fu is the type tophat
	uses to represent decimal numbers. There are also th.iu and th.uu. There is
	also th.Transform defined in the file. It describes a transformation using
	position, scale, rotation and rotation origin. Rotations in tophat are in degrees.
</p>

<h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom" id="images">2. loading and drawing an image</h2>

<p>
	First you need to import the <a href="/docs/image.html">image.um</a> module, which houses all sorts
	of image functions. We are interested in image.load. It takes a path to an image,
	which it loads and then returns. Example:
</p>

<pre>
	apple := image.load("gfx/apple.png")
</pre>

<p>
	That's all. The image is now ready to be drawn. That can be done by using it's
	draw method. You need to pass it a transform and a color filter. Color filter
	multiplies the color of each pixel by itself. If the filter is white, no changes
	are made. If it is black, the image is invisible.
</p>

<pre>
	apple.draw(th.Transform{
		p: th.Vf2{5, 20},
		s: th.Vf2{1, 1},
		r: th.Vf2{45}, th.white)
</pre>

<p>
	This draws the image at position [5, 20] rotated by 45 degrees.
</p>

<h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom" id="input">3. getting keyboards and mouse input</h2>


<p>
	Getting keyboard and mouse input in tophat is very simple. It is done through
	the <a href="/docs/input.html">input.um</a> package. Getting key and button input is done using
	the isKeyPressed and isKeyJustPressed functions. You need to provide a keycode
	which you are asking for. It can either be an ascii char (lowercase) or on of
	constants defined in the module. The difference between isPressed and
	isJustPressed is that isJustPressed returns true only if a key started being
	pressed last cycle. Example:
</p>

<pre>
	if input.isJustPressed('a') {
		printf("started holding A\n")
	}

	if input.isPressed('a') {
		printf("holding A\n")
	}
</pre>

<p>
	Getting mouse input is also easy. Information about mouse buttons is done the
	same way as key presses. Cursor position on the other hand has its own
	functions. getMousePos returns a th.Vf2 containing the mouse position in
	relation to screen. There is also getGlobalMousePos, which needs a camera as
	an argument and returns the mouse position in relation to world.
</p>

<pre>
	pos := input.getMousePos()
	if pos.x &lt; cam.w/2 &amp;&amp; pos.y &lt; cam.h/2 {
		printf("up-letf\n")
	}

	// these two are identical
	gpos := input.getGlobalMousePos(cam)
	gpos2 := cam.toWorld(input.getMousePos())
</pre>

<h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom" id="text">4. drawing text</h2>


<p>
	There are two main ways to draw text on screen. First one is using the drawText
	function in the <a href="/docs/canvas.um">canvas.um</a> module, which draws a line text. It can't do custom
	fonts, but can be very useful for debugging. The second one is using functions
	found in the <a href="/docs/font.um">font.um</a> module. First you need a font.
	That can be done by loading it from a file like so:
</p>

<pre>
	f := font.load("inconsolata.ttf")
</pre>

<p>
	You can then create an image with text by using the strToImage method. That is
	however slow as it re-renders everything every time you want the text to be
	updated. An alternative to this is using font.Cached - a wrapper around the
	default font that caches glyph for later use. It can be created from a normal
	font:
</p>

<pre>
	// black cached font from font f with resolution 2.
	cf := font.mkCached(f, th.black, 2)

	// optionally, you can pre cache some characters, so it isn't done
	// while the game runs.
	cf.preCacheStr("01234566789.")
</pre>

<p>
	Drawing can then be done using it's draw method.
</p>

<pre>
	cf.draw("pi = " + repr(std.pi), th.Transform{ s: th.Vf2{1, 1} })
</pre>


<p>
	Font support in tophat is very new and sadly very limited and buggy.
</p>

<h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom" id="sound">5. playing sounds</h2>


<p>
	Playing audio in tophat is very straight-forward. All of the needed things
	reside in the <a href="/docs/audio.html">audio.um</a> package. First you need to load a sound:
</p>

<pre>
	mySound := audio.load("sfx/music.mp3")
</pre>

<p>
	Supported formats are mp3, flac and wave. You can then use a set of functions
	to modify properties of the sound. For example you can make it loop or change
	it's volume.
</p>

<pre>
	mySound.looping(true)
	mySound.vol(0.5)
</pre>

<p>
	If you want to play it, use the play method.
</p>

<pre>
	mySound.play()
</pre>

<p>
	One sound can't be played two times at once. If a sound is playing, you can
	pause it, or stop it. The difference is stopping resets the progress.
</p>

<h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom" id="entities">6. entities</h2>


<p>
	Entities can be defined as a combination of an image and a collider. Entities
	are defined in the <a href="/docs/ent.html">ent.um</a> module. You can create one using the ent.mk
	function.
</p>

<pre>
	myEnt := ent.mk(
		image.load("player.png"),
		th.Tranform{
			s: th.Vf2{ 1, 1 },
			p: th.Vf2{ 20, 10 }})
</pre>

<p>
	The collider is a rect (affected by the transform). It is automatically set to
	the dimensions of the image, but can be set to something entirely else. You can
	draw the entity by calling its draw method.
</p>

<pre>
	myEnt.draw(cam)
</pre>

<p>
	Entities' image can be animated using it's animate method. You provide the target
	fps, an array of images and the current time.
</p>

<pre>
	myEnt.animate(4, &amp;walkAnim, th.time)
</pre>

<p>
	You need to call this every loop.
</p>

<h2 class="pb-2 border-bottom" id="distribution">7. distributing your game</h2>


<p>
	The easiest way to share your game it to put the tophat binary next to your
	source code and zip it. If you don't want the source to be too exposed, you
	can put it in tophat.dat/ and tophat will still run it. It is also recommended
	to download the binary for the other platform, so your game runs there too.
	You can even make a script to package the game for you.
